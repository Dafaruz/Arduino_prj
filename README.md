Car Battery Life Extension Project
Overview
This project focuses on extending the life of a car battery by reducing the wear caused by frequent engine starts. By integrating a supercapacitor alongside the car's battery, the system is designed to reduce the strain on the battery during the high-current demand of starting the engine. The supercapacitor charges and discharges quickly, supplying the initial burst of energy needed for starting, while the battery remains under lower load, prolonging its operational life.

Features
Supercapacitor Integration: A supercapacitor is connected to the vehicle's battery to provide additional support during startup, reducing the stress on the battery.
Voltage and Current Monitoring: The system continuously monitors the voltage and current from the battery and supercapacitor to optimize the process.
Load Balancing: The system can differentiate between different startup conditions and adapt accordingly to provide the necessary energy, reducing battery wear.
Automatic Disconnection: After the engine has started and the supercapacitor is fully charged, it disconnects to avoid unnecessary load on the battery.
Improved Battery Health: The system ensures smoother start-up cycles, which extends battery life and reduces the frequency of replacements.
